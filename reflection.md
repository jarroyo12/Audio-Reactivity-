# Reflection



- Do you think it is complete?
    Yes I think this is complete. 

- If not, what would you still like to add or change?

- What part are you most proud of?
    I am most proud of the sine wave movement in my piece. It's what gives the visuals a smooth and flowing feel. Seeing how the waves control the size, rotation, and color changes in such a natural way is satisfying. 

- What part are you least proud of?
    I am least proud of the lack of variety in the piece. I think it looks cool but I feel like adding more layers and effects could have made it more interesting over time.  

- What was the hardest part?
    The hardest part was getting the transitions between waves to feel smooth. At first the waves would shift too suddenly, which broke the flow of the piece that I wanted. 

- What, if anything, have you gained by completing this project?
    I got to experiment with audio reactivity to change the visuals in a way that it makes sense. Plus playing around with sine waves and randomness helped me understand how to create the visuals that feel harmonious. 


# Proposal 
    I want to work on an interactive 3D version of a cellular automata grid. My idea is to create a grid that updates based on cellular automata rules. Cellular automata is interesting to me because of how it interacts with its neighbors, changing its state according to the nearby cells. 
    For this project I want to focus on using cellular automata rules, using WEBGL mode to create a grid in 3D, and also adding a pulsing animation. I also want to play around with the colors of the grid. 
    I hope to deepen my understanding of 3D space and manipulating objects in that space. I also hope to get a better understanding of cellular automata principles, along with exploring animation techniques to make the project more visually appealing. 
    I expect to have problems when dealing with grid in 3D. Also making sure the project is complex when using cellular automata rules so that it is visually interesting but NOT RANDOM OR CONFUSING. I also expect this to be a bit boring so I'm hoping I think of a new element I can include that both makes sense to have in the piece and makes it more visually appealing.
