# Audio-Driven Wave Propagation

This project is an audio-reactive 3D visualization created with p5.js, where waves propagate across a grid of 3D ellipsoids that respond in real-time to the energy of an audio file. It combines physics simulations, wave behavior, and audio-reactivity to create a dynamic, evolving visual experience.

KEY FEATURES:
- This project analyzes the "treble" frequencies of the audio and maps this energy to control the wave speed and tile transformations, creating a seamless link between the sound and the visual experience.
- The waves are generated using sine functions, which simulate the natural expansion and contraction of sound waves across a 2D grid.
- Tiles change in size, color, and rotation based on the audioâ€™s influence, creating a vibrant, fluid motion that flows across the grid.
