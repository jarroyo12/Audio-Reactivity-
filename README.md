# Final Project - Open Season

This piece is a 3D visual that reacts to sound with ellipsoid shapes moving and pulsing in a grid. The grid changes in response to wind sound, creating a natural effect that mirrors the movement of wind. The waves start from random points and spreading outwards, blending into each other as they go. Each ellipsoid grows, rotates, and changes color based on waves that spread out from random starting points. The smooth transitions and animations create a visually appealing visual. There's no interaction needed. 

The idea for this piece started with me wanting to experiment with sine waves. And I wanted to keep my streak of using 3D elements. At first I wanted to use cellular automata, but it felt too structured for the kind of vibe I wanted for this piece. After playing around with different shapes, the ellipsoid was my favorite, it reminded me of a smooth, flowing movement, which led me to the wind theme. Each ellipsoid grows, rotates, and moves in response to the waves, creating depth and motion. To add to this piece further, I used audio reactivity to connect the visuals to the wind sound. The wind sound controls the speed of the waves. I also used randomness when it comes to the starting points of each wave so that the piece will never be repetitive or predictable. These techniques worked together to create a piece that is visually engaging.
